# CI-CD_Pipeline_Jenkins_GitHub_Actions_for_FlaskApp
CI/CD Pipeline creation for Flask App using both Jenkins and GitHub actions.

1. Jenkins CI CD pipeline for flask application
Objective:
Set up a Jenkins pipeline that automates the testing and deployment of a simple Python web application.
Requirements:
1. Setup:
- Install Jenkins on a virtual machine or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.
- Configure Jenkins with Python and any necessary libraries.
2. Source Code:
- Fork the provided Python web application repository on GitHub (provide a link to a sample Python web application repository).
- Clone the forked repository into your Jenkins server.
3. Jenkins Pipeline:
- Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your Python application repository.
- Define a pipeline with the following stages:
- Build: Install dependencies using pip.
- Test: Run unit tests using a testing framework like pytest.
- Deploy: If tests pass, deploy the application to a staging environment.
4. Triggers:
- Configure the pipeline to trigger a new build whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.
5. Notifications:
- Set up a notification system to alert via email when the build process fails or succeeds.
6. Documentation:
- Document the pipeline process and any prerequisites needed for the setup in a README.md file in the repository.
7. Submission:
- Provide the URL to the GitHub repository with the Jenkinsfile and updated README.md.
- Include screenshots of the Jenkins pipeline showing the build, test, and deployment stages.
Deliverables:
- Forked GitHub repository with Jenkinsfile.
- Documentation in README.md.
- Screenshots of the Jenkins pipeline execution.

  2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Flask App
    Objective:
    Implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions for a Python application.
Requirements:
1. Setup:
- Use a provided Python application repository on GitHub (provide a link to a sample Python application repository).
- Ensure the repository has a main branch and a staging branch.
2. GitHub Actions Workflow:
- Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository.
- Inside the directory, create a YAML file to define the workflow.
3. Workflow Steps:
- Define a workflow that performs the following jobs:
- Install Dependencies: Install all necessary dependencies for the Python application using pip.
- Run Tests: Execute the test suite using a framework like pytest.
- Build: If tests pass, prepare the application for deployment.
- Deploy to Staging: Deploy the application to a staging environment when changes are pushed to the staging branch.
- Deploy to Production: Deploy the application to production when a release is tagged.
4. Environment Secrets:
- Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information required for deployments (e.g., deployment keys, API tokens).
5. Documentation:
- Update the README.md file with instructions on how the GitHub Actions workflow works and how to configure the necessary secrets.
